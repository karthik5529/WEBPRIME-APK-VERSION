        <h3>SOMTHING I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU</h3><br><br>
        <h5>HELLO EVERYONE<br>I AM KARTHIK A COLLEGE STUDENT HERE I AM GOING TO SHARE SOME OF MY OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES WHICH I HAVE FACED IN MY LIFE<br><br>I HAVE COMPLETED MY SCHOOLING IN BOTH CBSE AND IN STATE BOARD OF TAMIL NADU TILL MY CLASS 12.. I HAVE STUDIED IN STATE BOARD FROM L.K.G - 5 TH STD AND FROM 6-12 I HAVE COMPLETED MY SCHOOLING IN CBSE AND .... ALSO I HAVE SOME INTREST IN IT-SECTOR DURING 2020 I THINK I BEGAN TO KNOW WHAT IS CODING AND LEARNT ALOT OF BASIC THINGS ABOUT CODING ... AND I ALSO HAVE ALOT OF DOUBTS THAT WHICH PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS NEEDED ONE FOR A BEGINNER THEN AFTER A LOT OF VIDEOS IN YOUTUBE I DECIDED TO LEARN PYTHON AS MY 1ST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IT'S ALL IN MY AGE OF 17 THEN I SAW MY 11 TH STD NCERT COMPUTER-SCIENCE BOOK AN AMAZING THING WAS IT IS ALSO FULLY ABOUT PYTHON SO I LEARNT PYTHON FOR 2 YEARS BY THE WAY ALTERNATIVELY I LEARNT MYSQL , HTML , CSS , JAVASCRIPT , REACT , MONGODB , JAVA IN MY HOLIDAYS OF MY CLASS 12 <br><br> THE COMMON THING I NOTICED IN MY CODING JOURNEY IS THAT LEARNING 1 ST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS SOMEWHAT TOUGH BECAUSE I LEARNT PYTHON FOR 2 YEARS BUT IT TOOK ME ONLY WEEKS TO LEARN JAVASCRIPT , JAVA BECAUSE AS A BIGINNER WE DON'T THE LOGICS WHICH MEANS I HAVE LEARNT PYTHON FOR 2 YEARS SO WHEN I TRY TO LEARN JAVA OR ANY OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE THE SYNTAX MAY CHANGE BUT THE LOGICS WON'T SO THIS WAS THE REASON I CAN EASILY LEARN MY 2ND 3RD ... LANGUAGES EASILY SO I SUGGEST YOU TO LEARN ONE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE COMPLTELY LET IT TAKE YEARS BUT LEARN IT FULLY ... SO THAT YOU CAN EASILY MOVE TO OTHER LANGUAGES <br><br> MY INTEREST IS ON FULL-STACK-WEB DEVELOPMENT AS IT WAS ALSO ONE OF THE HIGH-PAYING JOB IN INDIA SO I DECIDED TO LEARN IT ALSO STARTED LOVING TO LEARN FULL-STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT TOO BUT AFTER CERTAIN TIME I CAME TO KNOW THAT AS A FRESHER IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BECOME A FULL STACK DEVELOPER BECAUSE OF LESS JOB OPPURTUNITIES FOR FULL STACK DEVELOPER AS AN FRESHER .. IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE THEN YOU HAVE PEAK SALARIES AND MORE JOB VACCANCIES IN FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT SO MY SUGGESTION IF YOU WANT TO BECOME A FULL STACK DEVELOPER LEARN BOTH FRONT-END AND BACK-END BUT BE SURE THAT YOU SHOULD BE MORE STRONG IN ANY ONE END EITHER FRONT OR BACK ENDS WORK IN ANY ONE END FOR FEW MONTHS OR YEARS THEN SWITCH TO THE OTHER END AND GAIN MORE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES IN BOTH ENDS THEN MOVE TO FULL-STACK DEVELOPMENT <br><br>THANK YOU !<br>HOPE YOUV'E LEARNT SOMETHING FROM ME </h5>
